:experimental:

btn:[Textures] controls the Polygon counts in the models on the Tables. 

High::
The highest polygon count possible in the table models used in TPA. This is the default for this menu now.
Normal::
Hexagonal shaped round targets, and other trade-offs that make some playfield elements appear jaggy at distance, and blocky when zoomed in upon.

If you set this to the Normal setting, close ups of stand-up targets in Williams' _The Machine: Bride of Pinbot_ appear hexagonal. 

Set it to High, and they are far less hexagonal featuring about twice the polygon count.
