:experimental:

btn:[Textures] controls the Polygon counts in the table assets: 

* Playfield toys
* Targets
* Screws
* Other similar items. 

This affects the smoothness of round objects in the game, like stand-up targets.

High::
The highest polygon count possible in the table models used in TPA. 
This is the default for this menu now.
Normal::
A balanced polygon count that compromises on object smoothness in favour of performance. 

If you set btn:[Textures] to the Normal setting, close ups of stand-up targets in Williams' _The Machine: Bride of Pinbot_ appear hexagonal. Other trade-offs also happen that make some playfield elements appear jaggy at distance, and blocky when zoomed in upon.
