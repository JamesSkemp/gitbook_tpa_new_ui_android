:experimental:

btn:[Detail] controls the Level of Detail (LOD) of in-game assets.

High::
All elements originally present on the table. This is the default for this menu now.
Normal::
Less table detail means that certain high-pologon objects are disabled. A performance boost is gained for older devices.

btn:[Detail] affects what individual elements you see on the table. 
If you turn this setting from `High` to `Normal`, you will notice the difference. 

Elements like screw heads, transparencies, plastics, bulbs, even some playfield elements like the curly wires on Bally's _The Party Zone_ disappear. 

These elements put strain on the GPU to render them. 
If your device has a weak GPU, this setting will either need to be set to Standard, or may not even be visible to you.

NOTE: Detail —or "High LOD" as most regular TPA Android forum users refer to it as— was implemented http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7358-High-lod-model-beta[mid February 2014].
