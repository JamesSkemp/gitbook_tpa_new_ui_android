btn:[Mip Mapping] controls the sharpness of the "depth of field" in tables.

Technically speaking, it should be _Anisotropic Filtering_. 
UI button width limitations caused the label `Mip Mapping` to be chosen. 

TIP: See http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap[Wikipedia] for a concise description of the technology.

On::
Serves multiple mipmap images, and lets the GPU pick the best sample resolution for your specific device hardware. This is better for devices with limited GPU capabilities.
Off::
Deactivates the Mip Mapping function, which serves the highest resolution mipmap. This requires more GPU processing power, and as you can expect, this may add a performance impact for older devices.

Logic suggests turning this setting on would be advisable. `On` equals "good", right? This may not necessarily be the case.

The best advice for these two options is experiment with them on your device and see which setting delivers the best performance.
