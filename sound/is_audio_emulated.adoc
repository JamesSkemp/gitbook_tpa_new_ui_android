Audio is not purely emulated from the game ROM.
Audio is recorded with microphones placed in front of the speakers and the sound streamed from the game.

Mobile platforms circa 2012 could not emulate audio from the game ROM, while maintaining 60 FPS for correct physics.

FarSight can detect Standard and Wizard Goals based on which SFX plays back in the stream. 

It would have been difficult to detect goals without the audio extracted and orchestrated. 
This is also a factor contributing to the decision.
