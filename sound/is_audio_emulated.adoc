Audio is not purely emulated from the game ROM.
Audio is recorded with microphones placed in front of the speakers and the sound streamed from the game.

Mobile platforms circa 2012 were not able to emulate audio from the game ROM, while maintaining 60FPS for correct physics.

FarSight can detect Standard and Wizard Goals based on which SFX plays back in the stream. 

It would have been difficult to detect goals without the audio extraced and orchestrated. This is also a factor with recording rather than extracting and emulating audio.
