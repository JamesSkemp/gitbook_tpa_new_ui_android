FarSight still encodes audio for android at 11,000 Khz, which is low-quality mono. On other platforms, audio is encoded at 44,100 Khz, which is CD quality audio.

When audio loops, there is still a noticeable pause. This is down to limitations of the audio system FarSight uses.

As the platform progresses, FarSight will look at ways to boost the audio encoding rate to reduce sound artifacts like popping and crackling.
