When audio loops, there is a noticeable pause. 
This is called a gap in audio terms.

This fact is demonstrated in the game _No Good Gophers_. 

If you achieve a high score in the game, the music loop is very short and the loop gap noticeable.

This bug is caused by the following factors:

* issues with the audio system FarSight uses, known as the FAM.
* techniques used to reproduce audio files that are used in-game.

As the platform progresses, FarSight will look at ways to boost the audio encoding rate to reduce sound artifacts like popping and crackling.
