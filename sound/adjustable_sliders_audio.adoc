When the New UI released, the sound menu had three options for tuning the audio:

* SFX
* BGM
* Title Music

Each setting featured a slider that let you control the audio mix, and disable the cover of _Pinball Wizard_ that played infinitely.

The slider settings affected how the FAM mixed sound assets and it was discovered that some tables lost their in-game BGM. 

The adjustable sliders were removed and the global btn:[On | Off] toggle added.
