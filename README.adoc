A User Interface is like a joke: if you have to explain it, it's not that good.

This Help Center contains knowledge-base articles about FarSight Studio's _The Pinball Arcade_ Android app. 
The knowledge-base highlights aspects of the app that can not be adequately explained in-game.

This could be because of a combination of UI limitations and/or the complexity of the feature.

As the New UI evolves, some of these help articles can be removed.
