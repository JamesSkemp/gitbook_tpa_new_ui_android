WARNING: The launch button has priority over all flipper touch zones and tilt touch zones. Configure the button position so it does not interfere with with a flip or tilt touch zone. 

You may need to experiment with the different options until you find one with the right compromise. 

.About Touch Tilting
NOTE: Touch Tilting has its own set of touch positions. 
If you use touch tilting you need to take into account button position for both tilt and flip zones. This does not apply if you are using accelerometer tilting.
