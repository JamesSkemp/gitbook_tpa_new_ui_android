Williams' _White Water_ has a documented issue regarding the game audio. 

Production machines had issues with the compression techniques used on the MIDI audio.

When FarSight recorded the audio from their machine, these artifacts were present in the audio.

Norman Stepansky (Producer, Pinball Arcade) did consider removing the artifacts from the audio but decided to keep them in to re-create the authenticity of the simulation.
