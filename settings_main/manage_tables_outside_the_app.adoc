Yes, you can.

There is another way to manage tables that allows you to do away with the somewhat awkward menu in TPA. 
All you need is your favourite Android file browser.

The game DLC is stored in the `/sdcard/Android/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaProject/files/` folder.

It is arguably easier to navigate to this directory and delete files manually. 
The method through the UI works, but is slow.

Choose the UI method if you are not comfortable deleting files through the file system.
