The `Manage Tables` function in the btn:[Options] lets you update and delete tables from within the app.

IMPORTANT: `Update All` and `Download Owned` do not run as background processes. 
You must have TPA open all the time for this process to complete.

== Options

Update All::
Update all _downloaded_ tables present on the device that have received RES updates.
Download Owned::
Bulk download all owned tables _missing from the app_.
Purchases must be linked to your Google Play account, which you purchased the TPA Table Packs or Season Passes.
Delete::
Tap the button to the left of each table in the list to delete individual table files.
