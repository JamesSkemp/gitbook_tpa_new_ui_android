An User Interface is like a joke: if you have to explain it, it's not that good.

The FAQ contains information about features in TPA that can't be adequately explained in-game.

This could be because of a combination of UI limitations and/or the complexity of the feature.

As the New UI evolves, hopefully some of these help articles can be deleted.
