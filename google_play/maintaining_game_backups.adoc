As a general guideline:

* Back up after you achieve a Goal or a High Score in TPA.
* Back up no less than weekly if you are a regular TPA player.
* Back up no less than monthly if you are a casual player.

There is no way to schedule a Saved Games backup in the game, so you will need to rely on other systems to remind you. 

One strategy is to use the DLC cycle as my memory jogger to create a new Saved Game restore point.
