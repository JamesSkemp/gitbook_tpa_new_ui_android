Back up frequently to protect yourself against device malfunction.

As a general guideline:

* Back up after you achieve a Goal or a High Score in TPA.
* Back up no less than weekly if you are a regular TPA player.
* Back up no less than monthly if you are a casual player.

Use your discretion how often you back up, but *make sure* you create at least one restore point.
