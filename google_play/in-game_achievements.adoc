As of Season Six and over 70 tables, TPA does not have any vacant achievement slots available.

That means that GPS no longer tracks or awards XP points for goals achieved against Season 6 tables.

You can still earn achievements on Season One to Five Tables.

If chasing XP on Google Play is a goal for you, TPA offers lucrative points that are easy to achieve.
