Achievements are grouped together in GPS. 

There is an upper limit of achievements a game can support. This means that for each group of five Standard and Wizard goals, there is one achievement for each category.

To qualify for the GPS achievement, all goals in the goal set must be achieved before the GPS Achievement is awarded.

NOTE: As of Season Six, TPA does not have any vacant achievement slots available. That means that GPS no longer tracks or awards XP points for goals achieved against Season 6 tables.
